## Testing Objectives

The primary objectives of testing are to:

- Ensure the application correctly scrapes data from all supported sources
- Verify data processing and transformation functions work as expected
- Confirm data storage mechanisms operate correctly
- Validate visualization components render data accurately
- Ensure the application handles errors and edge cases gracefully
- Verify the application performs efficiently with large datasets
- Confirm the scheduler operates as expected

## Test Environment

### Development Environment

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment with all dependencies installed
- Local development machine

### CI Environment

- GitHub Actions or similar CI platform
- Python 3.8+ with dependencies installed
- Headless browser for web scraping tests

## Testing Tools

- **pytest**: Primary testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Code coverage reporting
- **VCR.py**: Record and replay HTTP interactions
- **pytest-mock**: Mocking functionality
- **pytest-benchmark**: Performance testing
- **tox**: Test against multiple Python versions
- **flake8**: Code style checking
- **mypy**: Static type checking

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, with dependencies mocked or stubbed.

#### Scraper Unit Tests

- Test parsing of mock HTML responses
- Test extraction of specific data points
- Test handling of different response formats
- Test error handling for invalid responses

#### Processor Unit Tests

- Test data cleaning functions
- Test normalization of different data formats
- Test handling of missing values
- Test data transformation functions

#### Storage Unit Tests

- Test data serialization and deserialization
- Test file/database operations with mock data
- Test query functionality
- Test error handling for storage operations

#### Visualization Unit Tests

- Test chart generation with mock data
- Test formatting and styling of visualizations
- Test export functionality

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly.

#### Scraper-Processor Integration

- Test scraper output can be processed correctly
- Test handling of real-world data patterns

#### Processor-Storage Integration

- Test processed data can be stored correctly
- Test data retrieval and querying

#### Storage-Visualization Integration

- Test visualization of stored data
- Test data aggregation and transformation for visualization

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests verify complete workflows from scraping to visualization.

- Test complete workflow with mock external services
- Test configuration-driven behavior
- Test command-line interface
- Test scheduling functionality

### Performance Tests

Performance tests ensure the application performs efficiently.

- Test scraping performance with large datasets
- Test processing performance with complex transformations
- Test storage performance with large volumes of data
- Test visualization performance with complex charts

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data

- Create a repository of mock HTML responses for each source
- Include both normal and edge cases
- Version control mock data alongside code

### Fixtures

- Create pytest fixtures for common test scenarios
- Implement factory fixtures for generating test data
- Use parametrized tests for testing multiple scenarios

### VCR Cassettes

- Record real HTTP interactions for testing
- Sanitize sensitive information in cassettes
- Update cassettes periodically to reflect site changes

## Test Automation

### Test Discovery

Tests will be organized following the pytest convention:

```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test_scrapers.py
│   ├── test_processors.py
│   ├── test_storage.py
│   └── test_visualization.py
├── integration/
│   ├── test_scraper_processor.py
│   ├── test_processor_storage.py
│   └── test_storage_visualization.py
├── e2e/
│   └── test_workflows.py
├── performance/
│   └── test_performance.py
└── conftest.py
```

### Running Tests

Tests can be run using the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run unit tests only
pytest tests/unit/

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=tradingapp

# Run tests and generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=tradingapp --cov-report=html
```
